    "\n",
    "1. The `ord` parameter specifies the type of norm (default is 2, which gives the Frobenius norm)\n",
    "2. The `axis` parameter allows computing norms along specific dimensions\n",
    "3. The `keepdims` parameter controls whether the dimensions are kept in the output\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- `linalg.norm(tensor, axis=0)` computes the norm along the first axis, resulting in a tensor with shape matching the original but without the first dimension\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "Yes, there is a significant difference in both memory footprint and computational speed depending on the order of matrix multiplication.\n",

    "- Then multiply by $\\mathbf{A}$: Final result is $2^{10} \\times 2^{14}$ (1024 × 16384)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key differences:\n",
    "1. **Memory footprint**: The intermediate result in Approach 2 ($\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{C}$) requires storing approximately $2^{30}$ elements (over a billion), whereas the intermediate result in Approach 1 ($\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}$) only requires storing $2^{15}$ elements (about 32 thousand). This is a difference of approximately $2^{15}$ times more memory!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Computational complexity**: Matrix multiplication of size $(m \\times n) \\times (n \\times p)$ requires approximately $O(m \\times n \\times p)$ operations.\n",
    "   - For Approach 1: $O(2^{10} \\times 2^{16} \\times 2^{5}) + O(2^{10} \\times 2^{5} \\times 2^{14}) = O(2^{31}) + O(2^{29})$\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Performance differences:**\n",
    "   - **Memory access patterns:** Matrix transposition changes memory access patterns. When computing $\\mathbf{C}^\\top$, the memory accesses are less cache-friendly because matrices are typically stored in row-major order. This leads to cache misses and slower performance.\n",
    "   - **Explicit transposition:** If $\\mathbf{C}^\\top$ is computed explicitly and stored before multiplication, this requires additional memory and time.\n",
    "   - **On-the-fly transposition:** Modern libraries might compute the transposition on-the-fly during multiplication, which avoids extra memory but can still be slower due to non-contiguous memory access.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. No additional memory is allocated for $\\mathbf{C}$ itself - it's just a different \"view\" of the same memory used by $\\mathbf{B}$.\n",
    "2. However, performance implications remain:\n",
    "   - $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}$ accesses $\\mathbf{B}$ with good cache locality\n",
    "   - $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{C}^\\top$ = $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}$ (mathematically identical) but might have different performance characteristics depending on how the matrix multiplication is implemented\n",

    "- Hardware considerations (cache size, memory bandwidth)\n",
